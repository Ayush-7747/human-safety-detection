# 🦺 Human Safety Detection using YOLOv11

This project is an **AI-powered object detection system** that helps improve worker safety on construction sites. It detects whether workers are wearing safety gear like **helmets** and **jackets**, and classifies them into four categories:

- 🟢 **Safe** – Wearing both helmet and jacket  
- 🔴 **Unsafe** – Missing one or more safety items  
- ⛑️ **Helmet** – Wearing helmet only  
- 👕 **Jacket** – Wearing jacket only  

The model is trained using a **custom dataset collected and annotated via Roboflow**, and it leverages **YOLOv11** for high-performance real-time detection.

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 Real-time object detection on images and videos  
- 🎯 Custom trained YOLOv11 model with 4 safety-related classes  
- 📊 Evaluation metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, **mAP50-95**, **mAP50**  
- 🧠 Robust dataset annotated using Roboflow  
- 🎥 Works on both CPU and GPU

## 🧪 Model Evaluation Results

| Metric         | Value  |
|----------------|--------|
| Precision      | 0.906  |
| Recall         | 0.867  |
| mAP50-95(B)    | 0.696  |
| mAP50(B)       | 0.925  |

📊 These results were obtained after training on a custom Roboflow dataset using YOLOv11 for 20 epochs on a 640x640 image size. The model shows strong detection accuracy for safety gear such as helmets and jackets.
